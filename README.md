# Employee Management System CRUD Application

This is a group project developed for [Enterprises Architecture]. The project aims to develop a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing employee records. It is developed using Java with NetBeans as the IDE, Java Swing for the user interface, and MySQL for the database.

## Features

- **Create:** Ability to add new employee records to the database.
- **Read:** View existing employee records.
- **Update:** Modify information of existing employee records.
- **Delete:** Remove employee records from the database.
- **GUI:** User-friendly graphical user interface built using Java Swing.
- **Database:** MySQL database backend for storing employee data.

## Tools Used

- **Java:** Programming language used for the application logic.
- **NetBeans:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development.
- **Java Swing:** Toolkit for building graphical user interfaces in Java.
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system for storing employee data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the project into NetBeans.
3. Set up the MySQL database with appropriate tables and configurations.
4. Configure the application to connect to your MySQL database.
5. Add all the necessary Java libraries.
6. Build and run the application.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Use the GUI to perform CRUD operations on employee records.
3. Explore various features such as searching and updating records.
4. Enjoy managing your employee data efficiently!

## Functionality by Group Members

In this application, it is divided into 2 main categories: **Add employees** and **Assign employees (assign Employees to the Job/Task**. Each category has its own CRUD operations. We had to create two interacting tables in the database because the assignment guide specifies that we must create at least two tables for CRUD Functions.



### Add Employees

- **>Create (Add Employee):** Implemented by KEG/IT/2021/F/0041 - Sandun LB. This functionality allows users to add new employee records to the database.
  
- **>Read (View Employee):** Implemented by KEG/IT/2021/F/0043 - Anjana. This functionality allows users to view existing employee records.
  
- **>Update (Update Employee):** Implemented by KEG/IT/2021/F/0090 - Maduranga. This functionality allows users to modify information of existing employee records.
  
- **>Delete (Delete Employee):** Implemented by KEG/IT/2021/F/0120 - Sahan. This functionality allows users to remove employee records from the database.



### Assign Employees

- **>Create (Assign Employee):** Implemented by KEG/IT/2021/F/0041 - Sandun LB. This functionality allows users to assign employees to specific tasks or jobs.
  
- **>Read (View Assigned Employee):** Implemented by KEG/IT/2021/F/0043 - Anjana. This functionality allows users to view employees who are currently assigned to tasks or jobs.
  
- **>Update (Update Assigned Employee Details):** Implemented by KEG/IT/2021/F/0090 - Maduranga. This functionality allows users to update details of employees who are already assigned to tasks or jobs, such as modifying their job roles or assignments.
  
- **>Delete (Delete Assigned Employees):** Implemented by KEG/IT/2021/F/0120 - Sahan. This functionality allows users to remove employees from their current assignments or tasks.
